<p>This page explains the advantages
of a multi-channel architecture
facilitating cross-border trade
by enabling Government to Government (G2G)
document exchange.</p>

<h2>Hubs models are obvious, but possibly wrong<a class="headerlink" href="#hubs-models-are-obvious-but-possibly-wrong" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>First, let’s start
by considering the alternative
to multi-channel architecture;
a single channel (or “Hub”) model.</p>

</p>
<p>In this model, there is a single logical Hub
that all messages pass through.
This logical Hub could be a distributed ledger,
traditional database, paper clearinghouse,
so some other technology.
The basic idea is that countries
send their messages to this hub
and receive their messages from it too.</p>
<p>Hub models require participants
to adopt a common technology platform.
This platform must meet the needs
of all participatnts
both in the moment and in the future.</p>
<p>Hub architectures have been built many times before.
Some people find this sort of design intuitively appealing,
perhaps because the idea of standardising on a single solution
seems like it should minimise interoperability challenges.</p>
<p>But standardising on a single implementation
solves interoperability the wrong way.
Interoperability comes from standard interfaces,
not from common implementation.
If two systems have an effective way to interoperate,
then there is no reason
for them to have the same implementation.
Individual participants should be free
to implement their parts of the system
in the way that makes the most sense to them.</p>

<p>The above illustration shows a multi-channel scenaro where:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Country A and Country E have a bilateral arangement for exchanging messages on any topic</p></li>
<li><p>There is a multilateral arangement
between Countries B, E and F
that supports messages on any topic</p></li>
<li><p>There is a multilateral arangement
between Countries A, B, C, F and G
that supports messages on a specific topic</p></li>
<li><p>There is a multilateral arangement
between Countries B, C, D, F, G and others (…)
that supports messages on any topic</p></li>
<li><p>There is an arangement between Country D and others
supporting messages on some specific topic.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>On first impression, the above scenario
might seem overcomplicated.
However, the reality of international trade
is vastly more complex than this diagram!</p>
<p>There three distinct reasons
why a multi-channel architecture is necessary.</p>
<div class="section" id="support-for-variable-topology">
<h3>Support for Variable Topology<a class="headerlink" href="#support-for-variable-topology" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Agreements between Countries are inherently bespoke.
Some are bilateral (links),
others are multilateral (networks).
The scope and details are customised
and optimised through a process of negotiation.
They changes over time,
as existing arangements are refined or adjusted
and new arangements are made.</p>
<p>Even if a hub model is theoretically better
(no such theory is offerd here),
the idea of asking almost 200 countries
to agree on a precice scope and details
for sharing cross-border trade documents
seems like it would be slow,
difficult and unlikely to succeed.</p>
<p>There are examples of universal hubs,
but they have narrow scope
(for example, ePhyto Certification).</p>
<p>It seems more pragmatic to assume that
cooperative sharing arangements
involving cross-border trade documentation
will involve a similar process of negotiation
to other international agreements.</p>
<p>While technical standardisation may reduce waste,
free countries will always ultimately determine
who they share what with, when and how;
and those arangements will change over time
with policy and circumstance.</p>
<p>Any design that does not support variable topologies
seems likly to result in a sub-optimal compromise.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="support-for-variable-technology">
<h3>Support for Variable Technology<a class="headerlink" href="#support-for-variable-technology" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Technical solutions for cross-border
document exchange have existed for many centuries.
Emerging technologies
(such as distributed ledgers)
have different characteristics
which may confer some advantages,
make new things possible
or make previously difficult things more easy.
No doubt technology will continue to evolve
and as-yet unimagined solutions will emerge
with even more favourable characteristics.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the best tehcnology choice in a given situation
would not be the best choice in a different situation.
The asset lifecycle of existing systems,
infrastructure, organisational capacities
and technology strategies of different groups
can create a prediliction
(or an aversion)
for specific technologies.</p>
<p>Even if it were possible to determine
a universal “best technology”
to implement cross-border trade document sharing,
that would be a fleeting anomoly.</p>
<p>Any design that does not allow countries
to negotiate technology choices
(and mutually agree to update or upgrade technology)
seems incongruent with
the other negotiated details
of international arangements.
An attempt to unilaterally impose
a single, unchanging technology choice
would not only require impractically challenging negotiation,
it would also pit the fate of the system
against the march of technological progress.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="support-for-variable-protocols">
<h3>Support for Variable Protocols<a class="headerlink" href="#support-for-variable-protocols" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The current proof of concept
supports a wire protocol that
we called “Discrete Generic Message” (DGM).
Each communication packet between countries
contains a single (“discrete”) message,
and there is no limit to
the taxonomy of message types
that could be sent
(generic).</p>
<p>This protocol was adequate and sufficient
for the first stage of our Proof Of Concept.
It may yet prove to be a useful protocol
in a wide range of situations.
However, there are also situations
where a different protocol design
may be more appropriate.</p>
<p>If there are very high message volumes,
or a technology is used with a low bandwith
(or high cost per transmission),
then a <em>batched</em> protocol design
may be more appropriate.
Rather than sending “discrete” messages
(one at a time)
a batch protocol could send
a compressed collection of messages
in in each packet.
This would involve trade-offs,
especially with all-or-nothing validation semantics
(such as blockchain consensus),
but there may be situations where
a batch protocol is the most practical choice.</p>
<p>Some distributed ledger technologies
support a feature called “Smart Contracts”.
These are sometimes known by other names,
such as “Transaction Families” or “Chain Code”,
but what they all have in common is that they allow
the channel to enforce mutually agreed policies
in a trustworthy way.
Smart contracts allow distributed ledger
to operate like an “independant umpire”,
which is potentially useful
in a wide variety situations
that require adversarial trust.
However, this has the downside
of tightly coupling policies
to the message transport mechanism.
This means the channel can only be used
for the purposes that correspond exactly
to the policies implemented in the smart contract.</p>
<p>Given the bespoke nature of international trade agreements,
developing a channel that fits them all well
could be very difficult or perhaps impossible.
The strategy of allowing multiple channels
might make the soluton seem more complicated
from some perspectives,
but if countries can route messages over multiple channels
then it should be possible for a country
to maintain integration with the collection of channels
that best fit their needs.</p>

<div class="section" id="interoperability-requires-standard-interfaces">
<h2>Interoperability requires standard interfaces<a class="headerlink" href="#interoperability-requires-standard-interfaces" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The multi-channel architecture theory needs to be tested.</p>
<p>This Proof of Concept software includes a “channel router” component,
with a mechanism for deciding which channel should be used for each message
(i.e. an “outbound message routing” mechanism).
It also includes a “channel observer” component,
which is a mechanism for accepting messages from different messages
and funneling them all into the same process regardless of how they are transmitted.</p>
<p>The code is designed in a way that assumes
that a standardised “Channel API” exists,
however an actual Channel API
has not been developed yet.</p>
<p>This requires active research,
which would benefit greatly from integrating
one (or preferably more) existing G2G message channels.</p>
<p>If a standard Channel API is developed
that can successfully be applied to existing G2G message channels,
then it should be possible
to provide an abstraction over the existing channels
such that:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Business to Government (B2G) transactions
operate against standard APIs,
which hide the details of which actual channel is used.</p></li>
<li><p>Governments should be able to modify their channel implementations
in way that insultates their regulated community from the change.
In other words, without impacting their users.</p></li>
<li><p>Makes it possible to integrate
additional, new channels
without modifying the standard Channel API design.</p></li>
</ul>
